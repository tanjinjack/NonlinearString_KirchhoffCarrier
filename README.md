# NonlinearString_KirchhoffCarrier
MATLAB script to compute nonlinear string vibration based on the Kirchhoff-Carrier equations. Refer to my thesis for more info:  https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01755039.

You'll only need to work with "KC_main.m". All parameter selections are commented in the script.
